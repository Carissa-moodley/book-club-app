                <h4>Welcome to our Online Book Club! We're so happy to have you here.</h4>
                <br>
                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <h5>Our book club was formed by a group of friends who share a deep love 
                    for reading. What started as casual discussions over coffee about
                    our favourite books quickly turned into something more. We realized 
                    that we wanted to create a communited where people from all walks 
                    of life could come together to share their passion for books, engage 
                    in meaningful discussions, and connect on a deeper level.</h5>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <h5>At the heart of our book club is the desire to foster a safe and 
                    welcoming space for everyone. We believe that books have the power 
                    bring people together, bridge differences, and open up new worlds 
                    of understanding. Whether you're an avid reader or just getting 
                    started, our community is here to support and isnpire you.</h5>
                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <h5>Each month, we gather virtually to discuss a book that we've 
                    collectively chosen. Our discussions are lively, respectful, and 
                    full of insights. We encourage members to share their thoughts, 
                    interpretations, and emotions evoked by the books we read. Beyond
                    our monthly meetings we offer a variety of activities such as author 
                    Q&A sessions, themed reading challenges and more.</h5>
                <h2>Join Us</h2>
                <h5>We invite you to become a part of our book club family. Whether 
                    you're looking to dive into new genres, find your next favourite 
                    book, or simply meet like-minded individuals, our community is the
